/**
 * Full-text search across all Dali vertex types.
 *
 * ArcadeDB does not support UNION ALL — queries run in parallel, merged in Java.
 * LIKE :q uses named parameter binding to prevent SQL injection.
 * The :q parameter value includes leading/trailing % wildcards (set in search()).
 *
 * Covered types (12 parallel queries):
 *   DaliTable       table_name     scope=schema_name (1-hop traversal)   score=1.0
 *   DaliColumn      column_name    scope=schema_name (2-hop traversal)   score=0.9
 *   DaliOutputColumn name          scope=session_id                       score=0.9
 *   DaliPackage     package_name   scope=package_name                     score=0.8
 *   DaliRoutine     routine_name   scope=package_name (1-hop traversal)  score=0.8
 *   DaliParameter   param_name     scope=session_id    score=0.75
 *   DaliVariable    var_name       scope=session_id    score=0.75
 *   DaliStatement   stmt_geoid     scope=package_name (2-hop) or session_id  score=0.6
 *   DaliSchema      schema_name    scope=db_name       score=0.7
 *   DaliDatabase    db_name        scope=db_name       score=0.7
 *   DaliApplication app_name       scope=''            score=0.7
 *   DaliSession     file_path      scope=db_name       score=0.5
